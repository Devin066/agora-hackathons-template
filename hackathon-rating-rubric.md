### Scoring Methodology

Each criterion is scored on a 1-5 scale:
- 5 (Exceptional): Exceeds expectations, innovative approach, could be production-ready
- 4 (Very Good): Strong implementation with minor areas for improvement
- 3 (Good): Meets requirements with solid execution
- 2 (Basic): Functional but lacks polish or depth
- 1 (Needs Work): Incomplete or significant issues

Final scores are calculated as weighted averages. Bonus points (up to +1) may be awarded for exceptional use of partner technologies or innovation.
