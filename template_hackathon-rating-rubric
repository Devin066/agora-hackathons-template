- One bonus point may be added for teams that effectively use additional Agora technologies

## Feedback Section

For each submission, judges should provide:

1. **Strengths**: Key positive aspects of the project
2. **Areas for Improvement**: Constructive feedback on how the project could be enhanced
3. **Additional Comments**: Any other relevant observations or suggestions
